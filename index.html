   <h1>Creation Myth</h1>
   <h3>Xerox PARC, Apple, and the truth about innovation.</h3>
   <div class="line-separator"></div>
   <h4>Posted May 16, 2011 by Malcom Gladwell</h4>

   <br></br>
     <h2>One</h2>
     <div class="line-separator"></div>
     <p>In late 1979, a twenty-four-year-old entrepreneur paid a visit to a
       research center in Silicon Valley called <a href="https://www.parc.com/" target="_blank">Xerox PARC</a>. He was the co-founder
       of a small computer startup down the road, in Cupertino. His name was Steve
       Jobs.</p>
     <p>Xerox PARC was the innovation arm of the Xerox Corporation. It was, and
       remains, on Coyote Hill Road, in Palo Alto, nestled in the foothills on
       the edge of town, in a long, low concrete building, with enormous terraces
       looking out over the jewels of Silicon Valley. To the northwest was Stanford
       University’s Hoover Tower. To the north was Hewlett-Packard’s sprawling
       campus. All around were scores of the other chip designers, software firms,
       venture capitalists, and hardware-makers. A visitor to PARC, taking in that
        view, could easily imagine that it was the computer world’s castle, lording
        over the valley below—and, at the time, this wasn’t far from the truth. In
        1970, Xerox had assembled the world’s greatest computer engineers and
        programmers, and for the next ten years they had an unparalleled run of
        innovation and invention. If you were obsessed with the future in the
        seventies, you were obsessed with Xerox PARC—which was why the young
        Steve Jobs had driven to Coyote Hill Road.</p>
     <p>Apple was already one of the hottest tech firms in the country. Everyone
        in the Valley wanted a piece of it. So Jobs proposed a deal: he would
        allow Xerox to buy a hundred thousand shares of his company for a million
        dollars—its highly anticipated I.P.O. was just a year away—if PARC would
        “open its kimono.” A lot of haggling ensued. Jobs was the fox, after all,
        and PARC was the henhouse. What would he be allowed to see? What wouldn’t
        he be allowed to see? Some at PARC thought that the whole idea was lunacy,
        but, in the end, Xerox went ahead with it. One PARC scientist recalls Jobs
        as “rambunctious”—a fresh-cheeked, caffeinated version of today’s austere
        digital emperor. He was given a couple of tours, and he ended up standing
        in front of a Xerox Alto, PARC’s prized personal computer.</p>
      <p>An engineer named Larry Tesler conducted the demonstration. He moved the
        cursor across the screen with the aid of a “mouse.” Directing a
        conventional computer, in those days, meant typing in a command on the
        keyboard. Tesler just clicked on one of the icons on the screen. He
        opened and closed “windows,” deftly moving from one task to another. He
        wrote on an elegant word-processing program, and exchanged e-mails with
        other people at PARC, on the world’s first Ethernet network. Jobs had
        come with one of his software engineers, Bill Atkinson, and Atkinson
        moved in as close as he could, his nose almost touching the screen.
        “Jobs was pacing around the room, acting up the whole time,” Tesler
        recalled. “He was very excited. Then, when he began seeing the things
        I could do onscreen, he watched for about a minute and started jumping
        around the room, shouting, ‘Why aren’t you doing anything with this?
        This is the greatest thing. This is revolutionary!'”</p>
        <br></br>
        <div class="bodyimage">
        <img src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/00/28/78/002878e6e2aa966cad52307f28bbcf21.jpg" alt="XeroxMouse"/>
        </div>
        <br></br>
      <p>Xerox began selling a successor to the Alto in 1981. It was slow and
        underpowered—and Xerox ultimately withdrew from personal computers
        altogether. Jobs, meanwhile, raced back to Apple, and demanded that the
        team working on the company’s next generation of personal computers
        change course. He wanted menus on the screen. He wanted windows. He
        wanted a mouse. The result was the Macintosh, perhaps the most famous
        product in the history of Silicon Valley.</p>
      <p>“If Xerox had known what it had and had taken advantage of its real
        opportunities,” Jobs said, years later, “it could have been as big as
        I.B.M. plus Microsoft plus Xerox combined—and the largest high-technology
        company in the world.”</p>
      <p>This is the legend of Xerox PARC. Jobs is the Biblical Jacob and Xerox
        is Esau, squandering his birthright for a pittance. In the past thirty
        years, the legend has been vindicated by history. Xerox, once the darling
        of the American high-technology community, slipped from its former
        dominance. Apple is now ascendant, and the demonstration in that room in
        Palo Alto has come to symbolize the vision and ruthlessness that separate
        true innovators from also-rans. As with all legends, however, the truth
        is a bit more complicated.</p>
     <h2>Two</h2>
     <div class="line-separator"></div>
    <p>After Jobs returned from PARC, he met with a man named Dean Hovey, who
      was one of the founders of the industrial-design firm that would become
      known as <a href="https://www.ideo.com/us" target="_blank">IDEO</a>. “Jobs went to Xerox PARC on a Wednesday or a Thursday, and
      I saw him on the Friday afternoon,” Hovey recalled. “I had a series of
      ideas that I wanted to bounce off him, and I barely got two words out of
      my mouth when he said, ‘No, no, no, you’ve got to do a mouse.’ I was, like,
      ‘What’s a mouse?’ I didn’t have a clue. So he explains it, and he says,
      ‘You know, [the Xerox mouse] is a mouse that cost three hundred dollars to
      build and it breaks within two weeks. Here’s your design spec: Our mouse
      needs to be manufacturable for less than fifteen bucks. It needs to not
      fail for a couple of years, and I want to be able to use it on Formica and
      my bluejeans.’ From that meeting, I went to Walgreens, which is still
      there, at the corner of Grant and El Camino in Mountain View, and I wandered
      around and bought all the underarm deodorants that I could find, because
      they had that ball in them. I bought a butter dish. That was the beginnings
      of the mouse.”</p>
    <p>I spoke with Hovey in a ramshackle building in downtown Palo Alto, where
      his firm had started out. He had asked the current tenant if he could borrow
      his old office for the morning, just for the fun of telling the story of
      the Apple mouse in the place where it was invented. The room was the size
      of someone’s bedroom. It looked as if it had last been painted in the Coolidge
      Administration. Hovey, who is lean and healthy in a Northern California
      yoga-and-yogurt sort of way, sat uncomfortably at a rickety desk in a corner
      of the room. “Our first machine shop was literally out on the roof,” he said,
      pointing out the window to a little narrow strip of rooftop, covered in green
      outdoor carpeting. “We didn’t tell the planning commission. We went and got
      that clear corrugated stuff and put it across the top for a roof. We got out
      through the window.”</p>
    <p>He had brought a big plastic bag full of the artifacts of that moment:
      diagrams scribbled on lined paper, dozens of differently sized plastic
      mouse shells, a spool of guitar wire, a tiny set of wheels from a toy train
      set, and the metal lid from a jar of Ralph’s preserves. He turned the lid
      over. It was filled with a waxlike substance, the middle of which had a
      round indentation, in the shape of a small ball. “It’s epoxy casting resin,”
      he said. “You pour it, and then I put Vaseline on a smooth steel ball, and
      set it in the resin, and it hardens around it.” He tucked the steel ball
      underneath the lid and rolled it around the tabletop. “It’s a kind of mouse.”</p>
    <p>The hard part was that the roller ball needed to be connected to the
      housing of the mouse, so that it didn’t fall out, and so that it could
      transmit information about its movements to the cursor on the screen. But
      if the friction created by those connections was greater than the friction
      between the tabletop and the roller ball, the mouse would skip. And the
      more the mouse was used the more dust it would pick up off the tabletop,
      and the more it would skip. The Xerox PARC mouse was an elaborate affair,
      with an array of ball bearings supporting the roller ball. But there was
      too much friction on the top of the ball, and it couldn’t deal with dust
      and grime.</p>
    <p>At first, Hovey set to work with various arrangements of ball bearings,
      but nothing quite worked. “This was the ‘aha’ moment,” Hovey said, placing
      his fingers loosely around the sides of the ball, so that they barely
      touched its surface. “So the ball’s sitting here. And it rolls. I attribute
      that not to the table but to the oldness of the building. The floor’s not
      level. So I started playing with it, and that’s when I realized: I <em>want</em> it
      to roll. I don’t want it to be supported by all kinds of ball bearings. I
      want to just barely touch it.”</p>
      <br></br>
      <div class="bodyimage">
      <img src="rolling-mouse.gif" alt="RollingMouse"/>
      </div>
      <br></br>
    <p>The trick was to connect the ball to the rest of the mouse at the two
      points where there was the least friction—right where his fingertips had
      been, dead center on either side of the ball. “If it’s right at midpoint,
      there’s no force causing it to rotate. So it rolls.”</p>
    <p>Hovey estimated their consulting fee at thirty-five dollars an hour; the
      whole project cost perhaps a hundred thousand dollars. “I originally
      pitched Apple on doing this mostly for royalties, as opposed to a consulting
      job,” he recalled. “I said, ‘I’m thinking fifty cents apiece,’ because I was
      thinking that they’d sell fifty thousand, maybe a hundred thousand of them.”
      He burst out laughing, because of how far off his estimates ended up being.
      ‘s pretty savvy. He said no. Maybe if I’d asked for a nickel, I would have
      been fine.”</p>
      <h2>Three</h2>
      <div class="line-separator"></div>
      <p>Here is the first complicating fact about the Jobs visit. In the legend
        of Xerox PARC, Jobs stole the personal computer from Xerox. But the
        striking thing about Jobs’s instructions to Hovey is that he <em>didn’t</em> want
        to reproduce what he saw at PARC. “You know, there were disputes around
        the number of buttons—three buttons, two buttons, one-button mouse,”
        Hovey went on. “The mouse at Xerox had three buttons. But we came around
        to the fact that learning to mouse is a feat in and of itself, and to
        make it as simple as possible, with just one button, was pretty important.”</p>
      <p>So was what Jobs took from Xerox the <em>idea</em> of the mouse? Not quite,
        because Xerox never owned the idea of the mouse. The PARC researchers
        got it from the computer scientist Douglas Engelbart, at Stanford Research
        Institute, fifteen minutes away on the other side of the university campus.
        Engelbart dreamed up the idea of moving the cursor around the screen with
        a stand-alone mechanical “animal” back in the mid- nineteen-sixties. His
        mouse was a bulky, rectangular affair, with what looked like steel
        roller-skate wheels. If you lined up Engelbart’s mouse, Xerox’s mouse,
        and Apple’s mouse, you would not see the serial reproduction of an object.
        You would see the evolution of a concept.</p>
        <br></br>
        <div class="bodyimage">
        <img src="mouse evolution.jpg" alt="Mouse Evolution"/>
        </div>
        <br></br>
      <p>The same is true of the graphical user interface that so captured Jobs’s
        imagination. Xerox PARC’s innovation had been to replace the traditional
        computer command line with onscreen icons. But when you clicked on an icon
        you got a pop-up menu: this was the intermediary between the user’s
        intention and the computer’s response. Jobs’s software team took the
        graphical interface a giant step further. It emphasized “direct manipulation.”
        If you wanted to make a window bigger, you just pulled on its corner and
        made it bigger; if you wanted to move a window across the screen, you just
        grabbed it and moved it. The Apple designers also invented the menu bar,
        the pull-down menu, and the trash can—all features that radically simplified
        the original Xerox PARC idea.</p>
        <br></br>
        <div class="bodyimage">
        <img src="http://pa1.narvii.com/6301/2fb3a51c9ef6c93fa9b4ec7b0f6c98afc360cdc8_hq.gif" alt="XeroxMouse"/>
        </div>
        <br></br>
      <p>The difference between direct and indirect manipulation—between three
        buttons and one button, three hundred dollars and fifteen dollars, and
        a roller ball supported by ball bearings and a free-rolling ball—is not
        trivial. It is the difference between something intended for experts,
        which is what Xerox PARC had in mind, and something that’s appropriate
        for a mass audience, which is what Apple had in mind. PARC was building
        a personal computer. Apple wanted to build a <em>popular</em> computer.</p>
      <p>In a recent study, “The Culture of Military Innovation,” the military
        scholar Dima Adamsky makes a similar argument about the so-called Revolution
        in Military Affairs. R.M.A. refers to the way armies have transformed
        themselves with the tools of the digital age—such as precision-guided
        missiles, surveillance drones, and real-time command, control, and
        communications technologies—and Adamsky begins with the simple observation
        that it is impossible to determine who invented R.M.A. The first people
        to imagine how digital technology would transform warfare were a cadre of
        senior military intellectuals in the Soviet Union, during the
        nineteen-seventies. The first country to come up with these high-tech
        systems was the United States. And the first country to use them was
        Israel, in its 1982 clash with the Syrian Air Force in Lebanon’s Bekaa
        Valley, a battle commonly referred to as “the Bekaa Valley turkey shoot.”
         Israel coördinated all the major innovations of R.M.A. in a manner so
         devastating that it destroyed nineteen surface-to-air batteries and
         eighty-seven Syrian aircraft while losing only a handful of its own planes.</p>
        <p>That’s three revolutions, not one, and Adamsky’s point is that each
          of these strands is necessarily distinct, drawing on separate skills
          and circumstances. The Soviets had a strong, centralized military
          bureaucracy, with a long tradition of theoretical analysis. It made
          sense that they were the first to understand the military implications
          of new information systems. But they didn’t do anything with it,
          because centralized military bureaucracies with strong intellectual
          traditions aren’t very good at connecting word and deed.</p>
        <p>The United States, by contrast, has a decentralized, bottom-up
          entrepreneurial culture, which has historically had a strong orientation
          toward technological solutions. The military’s close ties to the country’
          high-tech community made it unsurprising that the U.S. would be the first
          to invent precision-guidance and next-generation command-and-control
          communications. But those assets also meant that Soviet-style systemic
          analysis wasn’t going to be a priority. As for the Israelis, their
          military culture grew out of a background of resource constraint and
          constant threat. In response, they became brilliantly improvisational
          and creative. But, as Adamsky points out, a military built around urgent,
          short-term “fire extinguishing” is not going to be distinguished by
          reflective theory. No one stole the revolution. Each party viewed the
          problem from a different perspective, and carved off a different piece
          of the puzzle.</p>
        <p>In the history of the mouse, Engelbart was the Soviet Union. He was
          the visionary, who saw the mouse before anyone else did. But visionaries
          are limited by their visions. “Engelbart’s self-defined mission was not
          to produce a product, or even a prototype; it was an open-ended search
          for knowledge,” Matthew Hiltzik writes, in “Dealers of Lightning” (1999),
          his wonderful history of Xerox PARC. “Consequently, no project in his
          lab ever seemed to come to an end.” Xerox PARC was the United States:
          it was a place where things got made. “Xerox created this perfect
          environment,” recalled Bob Metcalfe, who worked there through much of
          the nineteen-seventies, before leaving to found the networking company
          3Com. “There wasn’t any hierarchy. We built out our own tools. When we
          needed to publish papers, we built a printer. When we needed to edit
          the papers, we built a computer. When we needed to connect computers,
          we figured out how to connect them. We had big budgets. Unlike many of
          our brethren, we didn’t have to teach. We could just research. It was heaven.”</p>
        <p>But heaven is not a good place to commercialize a product. “We built
          a computer and it was a beautiful thing,” Metcalfe went on. “We developed
          our computer language, our own display, our own language. It was a
          gold-plated product. But it cost sixteen thousand dollars, and it needed
          to cost three thousand dollars.” For an actual product, you need threat
          and constraint—and the improvisation and creativity necessary to turn a
          gold-plated three-hundred-dollar mouse into something that works on Formica
          and costs fifteen dollars. Apple was Israel.</p>
        <p>Xerox <em>couldn’t</em> have been I.B.M. and Microsoft combined, in other words.
          “You can be one of the most successful makers of enterprise technology
          products the world has ever known, but that doesn’t mean your instincts
          will carry over to the consumer market,” the tech writer Harry McCracken
          recently wrote. “They’re really different, and few companies have ever
          been successful in both.” He was talking about the decision by the
          networking giant Cisco System, this spring, to shut down its Flip camera
          business, at a cost of many hundreds of millions of dollars. But he
          could just as easily have been talking about the Xerox of forty years
          ago, which was one of the most successful makers of enterprise technology
          the world has ever known. The fair question is whether Xerox, through
          its research arm in Palo Alto, found a better way to be Xerox—and the
          answer is that it did, although that story doesn’t get told nearly as often.</p>
          <h2>Four</h2>
          <div class="line-separator"></div>
        <p>One of the people at Xerox PARC when Steve Jobs visited was an optical
          engineer named Gary Starkweather. He is a solid and irrepressibly cheerful
          man, with large, practical hands and the engineer’s gift of pretending
          that what is impossibly difficult is actually pretty easy, once you shave
          off a bit here, and remember some of your high-school calculus, and realize
          that the thing that you thought should go in left to right should actually
          go in right to left. Once, before the palatial Coyote Hill Road building
          was constructed, a group that Starkweather had to be connected to was
          moved to another building, across the Foothill Expressway, half a mile
          away. There was no way to run a cable under the highway. So Starkweather
          fired a laser through the air between the two buildings, an improvised
          communications system that meant that, if you were driving down the
          Foothill Expressway on a foggy night and happened to look up, you might
          see a mysterious red beam streaking across the sky. When a motorist drove
          into the median ditch, “we had to turn it down,” Starkweather recalled,
          with a mischievous smile.</p>
        <p>Lasers were Starkweather’s specialty. He started at Xerox’s East Coast
          research facility in Webster, New York, outside Rochester. Xerox built
          machines that scanned a printed page of type using a photographic lens,
          and then printed a duplicate. Starkweather’s idea was to skip the first
          step—to run a document from a computer directly into a photocopier, by
          means of a laser, and turn the Xerox machine into a printer. It was a
          radical idea. The printer, since Gutenberg, had been limited to the
          function of re-creation: if you wanted to print a specific image or letter,
          you had to have a physical character or mark corresponding to that image
          or letter. What Starkweather wanted to do was take the array of bits and
          bytes, ones and zeros that constitute digital images, and transfer them
          straight into the guts of a copier. That meant, at least in theory, that
          he could print anything.</p>
        <p>“One morning, I woke up and I thought, Why don’t we just print something
          out directly?” Starkweather said. “But when I flew that past my boss he
          thought it was the most brain-dead idea he had ever heard. He basically
          told me to find something else to do. The feeling was that lasers were
          too expensive. They didn’t work that well. Nobody wants to do this,
          computers aren’t powerful enough. And I guess, in my naïveté, I kept
          thinking, He’s just not right—there’s something about this I really like.
          It got to be a frustrating situation. He and I came to loggerheads over
          the thing, about late 1969, early 1970. I was running my experiments in
          the back room behind a black curtain. I played with them when I could.
          He threatened to lay off my people if I didn’t stop. I was having to make
          a decision: do I abandon this, or do I try and go up the ladder with it?”</p>
        <p>Then Starkweather heard that Xerox was opening a research center in Palo
          Alto, three thousand miles away from its New York headquarters. He went
          to a senior vice-president of Xerox, threatening to leave for I.B.M. if
          he didn’t get a transfer. In January of 1971, his wish was granted, and,
          within ten months, he had a prototype up and running.</p>
        <p>Starkweather is retired now, and lives in a gated community just north
          of Orlando, Florida. When we spoke, he was sitting at a picnic table,
          inside a screened-in porch in his back yard. Behind him, golfers whirred
          by in carts. He was wearing white chinos and a shiny black short-sleeved
          shirt, decorated with fluorescent images of vintage hot rods. He had
          brought out two large plastic bins filled with the artifacts of his
          research, and he spread the contents on the table: a metal octagonal disk,
          sketches on lab paper, a black plastic laser housing that served as the
          innards for one of his printers.</p>
        <p>“There was still a tremendous amount of opposition from the Webster
          group, who saw no future in computer printing,” he went on. “They said,
          ‘I.B.M. is doing that. Why do we need to do that?’ and so forth. Also,
          there were two or three competing projects, which I guess I have the
          luxury of calling ridiculous. One group had fifty people and another
          had twenty. I had two.” Starkweather picked up a picture of one of his
          in-house competitors, something called an “optical carriage printer.”
          It was the size of one of those modular Italian kitchen units that you
          see advertised in fancy design magazines. “It was an unbelievable device,”
          he said, with a rueful chuckle. “It had a ten-inch drum, which turned
          at five thousand r.p.m., like a super washing machine. It had characters
          printed on its surface. I think they only ever sold ten of them. The problem
           was that it was spinning so fast that the drum would blow out and the
           characters would fly off. And there was only this one lady in Troy, New
           York, who knew how to put the characters on so that they would stay.</p>
          <p>“So we finally decided to have what I called a fly-off. There was a
            full page of text—where some of them were non-serif characters, Helvetica,
             stuff like that—and then a page of graph paper with grid lines, and
             pages with pictures and some other complex stuff—and everybody had
             to print all six pages. Well, once we decided on those six pages, I
             knew I’d won, because I knew there wasn’t anything I couldn’t print.
             Are you kidding? If you can translate it into bits, I can print it.
             Some of these other machines had to go through hoops just to print a
             curve. A week after the fly-off, they folded those other projects.
             I was the only game in town.” The project turned into the Xerox 9700,
             the first high-speed, cut-paper laser printer in the world.</p>
             <h2>Five</h2>
             <div class="line-separator"></div>
          <p>In one sense, the Starkweather story is of a piece with the Steve
            Jobs visit. It is an example of the imaginative poverty of Xerox
            management. Starkweather had to hide his laser behind a curtain. He
            had to fight for his transfer to PARC. He had to endure the indignity
            of the fly-off, and even then Xerox management remained skeptical.
            The founder of PARC, Jack Goldman, had to bring in a team from Rochester
            for a personal demonstration. After that, Starkweather and Goldman had
            an idea for getting the laser printer to market quickly: graft a laser
            onto a Xerox copier called the 7000. The 7000 was an older model, and
            Xerox had lots of 7000s sitting around that had just come off lease.
            Goldman even had a customer ready: the Lawrence Livermore laboratory
            was prepared to buy a whole slate of the machines. Xerox said no. Then
            Starkweather wanted to make what he called a photo-typesetter, which
            produced camera-ready copy right on your desk. Xerox said no. “I wanted
            to work on higher-performance scanners,” Starkweather continued. “In
            other words, what if we print something other than documents? For
            example, I made a high-resolution scanner and you could print on glass
            plates.” He rummaged in one of the boxes on the picnic table and came
            out with a sheet of glass, roughly six inches square, on which a photograph
            of a child’s face appeared. The same idea, he said, could have been used
            to make “masks” for the semiconductor industry—the densely patterned
            screens used to etch the designs on computer chips. “No one would ever
            follow through, because Xerox said, ‘Now you’re in Intel’s market, what
            are you doing that for?’ They just could not seem to see that they were
            in the information business. This”—he lifted up the plate with the little
            girl’s face on it— “is a copy. It’s just not a copy of an office document.”
            But he got nowhere. “Xerox had been infested by a bunch of spreadsheet
            experts who thought you could decide every product based on metrics.
            Unfortunately, creativity wasn’t on a metric.”</p>
          <p>A few days after that afternoon in his back yard, however, Starkweather
            e-mailed an addendum to his discussion of his experiences at PARC.
            “Despite all the hassles and risks that happened in getting the laser
            printer going, in retrospect the journey was that much more exciting,”
            he wrote. “Often difficulties are just opportunities in disguise.”
            Perhaps he felt that he had painted too negative a picture of his time
            at Xerox, or suffered a pang of guilt about what it must have been like
            to be one of those Xerox executives on the other side of the table.
            The truth is that Starkweather was a difficult employee. It went hand
            in hand with what made him such an extraordinary innovator. When his
            boss told him to quit working on lasers, he continued in secret. He
            was disruptive and stubborn and independent-minded—and he had a thousand
            ideas, and sorting out the good ideas from the bad wasn’t always easy.
            Should Xerox have put out a special order of laser printers for Lawrence
            Livermore, based on the old 7000 copier? In “Fumbling the Future: How
            Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer” (1988)—a
            book dedicated to the idea that Xerox was run by the blind—Douglas Smith
            and Robert Alexander admit that the proposal was hopelessly impractical:
            “The scanty Livermore proposal could not justify the investment required
            to start a laser printing business.... How and where would Xerox manufacture
            the laser printers? Who would sell and service them? Who would buy them
            and why?” Starkweather, and his compatriots at Xerox PARC, weren’t the
            source of disciplined strategic insights. They were wild geysers of
            creative energy.</p>
          <p>The psychologist Dean Simonton argues that this fecundity is often
            at the heart of what distinguishes the truly gifted. The difference
            between Bach and his forgotten peers isn’t necessarily that he had a
            better ratio of hits to misses. The difference is that the mediocre
            might have a dozen ideas, while Bach, in his lifetime, created more
            than a thousand full-fledged musical compositions. A genius is a genius,
            Simonton maintains, because he can put together such a staggering number
            of insights, ideas, theories, random observations, and unexpected
            connections that he almost inevitably ends up with something great.
            “Quality,” Simonton writes, is “a probabilistic function of quantity.”</p>
          <p>Simonton’s point is that there is nothing neat and efficient “The more
            successes there are,” he says, “the more failures there are as well” —
            meaning that the person who had far more ideas than the rest of us will
            have far more bad ideas than the rest of us, too. This is why managing
            the creative process is so difficult. The making of the classic Rolling
            Stones album “Exile on Main Street” was an ordeal, Keith Richards writes
            in his new memoir, because the band had too many ideas. It had to fight
            from under an avalanche of mediocrity: “Head in the Toilet Blues,”
            “Leather Jackets,” “Windmill,” “I Was Just a Country Boy,” “Bent Green
            Needles,” “Labour Pains,” and “Pommes de Terre”—the last of which Richards
            explains with the apologetic, “Well, we were in France at the time.”</p>
          <p>At one point, Richards quotes a friend, Jim Dickinson, remembering the
             origins of the song “Brown Sugar”:</p>
          <p>I watched Mick write the lyrics.... He wrote it down as fast as
            he could move his hand. I’d never seen anything like it. He had one
            of those yellow legal pads, and he’d write a verse a page, just write
            a verse and then turn the page, and when he had three pages filled,
            they started to cut it. It was amazing.</p>
          <p>Richards goes on to marvel, “It’s unbelievable how prolific he was.”
             Then he writes, “Sometimes you’d wonder how to turn the fucking tap
             off. The odd times he would come out with so many lyrics, you’re
             crowding the airwaves, boy.” Richards clearly saw himself as the
             creative steward of the Rolling Stones (only in a rock-and-roll band,
             by the way, can someone like Keith Richards perceive himself as the
             responsible one), and he came to understand that one of the hardest
             and most crucial parts of his job was to “turn the fucking tap off,”
             to rein in Mick Jagger’s incredible creative energy.</p>
          <p>The more Starkweather talked, the more apparent it became that his
            entire career had been a version of this problem. Someone was always
            trying to turn his tap off. But someone <em>had</em> to turn his tap off: the
            interests of the innovator aren’t perfectly aligned with the interests
            of the corporation. Starkweather saw ideas on their own merits. Xerox
            was a multinational corporation, with shareholders, a huge sales force,
            and a vast corporate customer base, and it needed to consider every new
            idea within the context of what it already had.</p>
          <p>Xerox’s managers didn’t always make the right decisions when they said
            no to Starkweather. But he got to PARC, didn’t he? And Xerox, to its
            great credit, <em>had</em> a PARC—a place where, a continent away from the top
            managers, an engineer could sit and dream, and get every purchase order
            approved, and fire a laser across the Foothill Expressway if he was so
            inclined. Yes, he had to pit his laser printer against lesser ideas in
            the contest. But he won the contest. And, the instant he did, Xerox
            cancelled the competing projects and gave him the green light.</p>
          <p>“I flew out there and gave a presentation to them on what I was looking
            at,” Starkweather said of his first visit to PARC. “They really liked
            it, because at the time they were building a personal computer, and
            they were beside themselves figuring out how they were going to get
            whatever was on the screen onto a sheet of paper. And when I showed
            them how I was going to put prints on a sheet of paper it was a marriage
            made in heaven.” The reason Xerox invented the laser printer, in other
            words, is that it invented the personal computer. Without the big idea,
            it would never have seen the value of the small idea. If you consider
            innovation to be efficient and ideas precious, that is a tragedy: you
            give the crown jewels away to Steve Jobs, and all you’re left with is
            a printer. But in the real, messy world of creativity, giving away the
            thing you don’t really understand for the thing that you do is an
            inevitable tradeoff.</p>
          <p>“When you have a bunch of smart people with a broad enough charter,
            you will always get something good out of it,” Nathan Myhrvold, formerly
            a senior executive at Microsoft, argues. “It’s one of the best investments
            you could possibly make—but only if you chose to value it in terms of
            successes. If you chose to evaluate it in terms of how many times you
            failed, or times you could have succeeded and didn’t, then you are bound
            to be unhappy. Innovation is an unruly thing. There will be some ideas
            that don’t get caught in your cup. But that’s not what the game is about.
            The game is what you catch, not what you spill.”</p>
          <p>In the nineteen-nineties, Myhrvold created a research laboratory at
            Microsoft modelled in part on what Xerox had done in Palo Alto in the
            nineteen-seventies, because he considered PARC a triumph, not a failure.
            “Xerox did research outside their business model, and when you do that
            you should not be surprised that you have a hard time dealing with
            it—any more than if some bright guy at Pfizer wrote a word processor.
            Good luck to Pfizer getting into the word-processing business.
            Meanwhile, the thing that they invented that was similar to their own
            business—a really big machine that spit paper —they made a lot of money
            on it.” And so they did. Gary Starkweather’s laser printer made billions
            for Xerox. It paid for every other single project at Xerox PARC, many
            times over.</p>
            <h2>Six</h2>
            <div class="line-separator"></div>
          <p>In 1988, Starkweather got a call from the head of one of Xerox’s
            competitors, trying to lure him away. It was someone whom he had met
            years ago. “The decision was painful,” he said. “I was a year from
            being a twenty-five-year veteran of the company. I mean, I’d done
            enough for Xerox that unless I burned the building down they would
            never fire me. But that wasn’t the issue. It’s about having ideas
            that are constantly squashed. So I said, ‘Enough of this,’ and I left.”</p>
          <p>He had a good many years at his new company, he said. It was an
            extraordinarily creative place. He was part of decision-making at the
            highest level. “Every employee from technician to manager was hot for
            the new, exciting stuff,” he went on. “So, as far as buzz and daily
            environment, it was far and away the most fun I’ve ever had.” But it
            wasn’t perfect. “I remember I called in the head marketing guy and I
            said, ‘I want you to give me all the information you can come up with
            on when people buy one of our products—what software do they buy, what
            business are they in—so I can see the model of how people are using
            the machines.’ He looked at me and said, ‘I have no idea about that.’
            ” Where was the rigor? Then Starkweather had a scheme for hooking up
            a high-resolution display to one of his new company’s computers. “I
            got it running and brought it into management and said, ‘Why don’t we
            show this at the tech expo in San Francisco? You’ll be able to rule
            the world.’ They said, ‘I don’t know. We don’t have room for it.’ It
            was that sort of thing. It was like me saying I’ve discovered a gold
            mine and you saying we can’t afford a shovel.”</p>
          <p>He shrugged a little wearily. It was ever thus. The innovator says
            go. The company says stop—and maybe the only lesson of the legend of
            Xerox PARC is that what happened there happens, in one way or another,
            everywhere. By the way, the man who hired Gary Starkweather away to
            the company that couldn’t afford a shovel? His name was Steve Jobs.</p>
